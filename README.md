# Data-Encryption-Standard
I did the encryption and decryption in the same file:
1. After giving the code the key, plain text and number of number of times to run the encryption
2. the code will execute and print many useful information that I used for testing
3. at the end it will print the plain text and the cipher text.
4. then the code will ask if u want to decrypt or no (1 for yes and 0 for no)
